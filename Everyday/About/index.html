   <h2>About the Project</h2>
   <br>

   <p class="prompt">The 2023 Undergraduate Annual Exhibition draws inspiration from the Zimmerli Art Museum’s fall exhibition, Beauty Among the Ordinary Things, featuring the photographs of William Armbruster. Mixing documentary with Pictorialism, Armbruster’s vision was at once an idealization of a rapidly receding past and a buffer against the unsettling effects of New Jersey’s rapid industrialization and modernization.

   In considering our own moment of great social, technological, and political transition, students are invited to use the technique of defamiliarization to transform an ordinary, everyday scene, routine, idea, or experience into something extraordinary. How might thinking and seeing beyond our habitual frames of vision and thought allow us to respond to the truly exceptional conditions of our present moment? Using any materials available to you, present something meaningful that is often passed by, unconsidered, or habitually unseen.

<p class="response">
In response to this prompt, I wanted to explore the evolution of what an everyday looks. I specifically took inspiration from the 'Soviet Everyday' exhibition from Zimmerli Art Museum and wanted to highlight the different between my everyday in comparison to my grandparents.
